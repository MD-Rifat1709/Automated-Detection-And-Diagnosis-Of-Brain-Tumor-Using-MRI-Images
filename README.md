# Automated-Detection-And-Diagnosis-Of-Brain-Tumor-Using-MRI-Images

This project work presents an automated detection and diagnosis of brain tumor using
MRI Images, where we build a system which automatically generates a preliminary report which
contains the type of tumor, its corresponding ICD code, tumor diameter and tumor area along
with the original input image with the tumor highlighted for visualization. This will be achieved
through classification and segmentation of the MRI Images, where the classification will be done
to identify the tumor type and ICD code and segmentation will be done to visualize the tumor and
to find its diameter and area. For our project, a preliminary report is being constructed which
utilizes one MRI image of a brain tumor to diagnose tumor diameter and tumor area.
